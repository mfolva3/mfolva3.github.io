<p> Here are a few projects that I have worked on so far. Some of them are
  simple from when I was starting out, but others are very complex.
  Feel free to explore and take a glance. This is still a work in progress and
I hope to have more projects uploaded soon, and then implement them through
Django to make them interactive for viewers. </p>
