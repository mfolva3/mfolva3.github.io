<h2><b> October 11, 2017 </b> </h2>

<p><i>Notes : </i> Happy Ada Lovelace Day! The second Tuesday of every month is Ada Lovelace Day.
This year it landed on October 10th.

<a href= "https://findingada.com/about/who-was-ada/" target="_blank">Ada Lovelace</a> is credited with creating the first algorithm to be used by a computing machine.

Today, she is a symbol for women in computer science.
</p>

<p><i> Today in class : </i> Today in class we will be going over strings, integers, floats and IO (input/output) operations. </p>

<h3> 1) strings  </h3>

<p>Denoted as <i>string</i>. User input is always taken in as a string.<br>
In Python, strings are characters inside quote signs. You can use double quotes ("string") or
single quotes ('string') to denote a string, BUT the quotes must be of the same type.
For example, "string' is not valid in Python. </p>


<h3> 2) integers  </h3>

<p> Denoted as <i>int</i>. In simpler terms, integers are whole numbers. (ie: ...,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4...) <br>

Since user input is taken in as a string, we can convert a number taken in as a string to an integer type
as follows : </p>

<p2> s = '123' <br>
  x = int(s) #this is saying int('123')<br>

</p2>


<h3> 3) floats  </h3>
