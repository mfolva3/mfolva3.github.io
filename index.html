  <h1> Maria Folvarska</h1>
  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Maria, and I am currently
    an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago pursuing
    a dual-degree in
    Math and Computer Science and History. I am also pursuing two linguistic
    minors-- French and Russian. I have always had a passion for languages, as I
    grew up in a household speaking three languages -- Slovak, Rusyn, and
    English. I began my university career by applying my love of language
    through history, specifically honing in on Eastern European and Russian
    history, however, I now strive to expand my love of language by
    exploring the world of Math and Computer Science.</p>
