  <h1> Maria Folvarska</h1>
  <h2>Welcome to my page! </h2>
  <p> Feel free to explore! This a website project I am working on to further
    explore computer science and its capabilities. I am sprecifically using it to
    develop my HTML/CSS skills. The site is still under
    construction, so please make sure to check back for updates. </p>

  <p>  My name is Maria, and I am currently
    an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Chicago pursuing
    a dual-degree in
    Math and Computer Science and History. I am also pursuing two linguistic
    minors in French and Russian. I have always had a passion for languages, as
    I grew up in a household speaking three languages(Slovak, Rusyn, and
    English). I began my university career by applying my love of language
    through history, specifically honing in on Eastern European and Russian
    history; however, I now strive to expand my love of language by
    exploring the worlds of math and computer Science.</p>
